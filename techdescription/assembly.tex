Assembly of a dismantled cube requires the following steps:\begin{enumerate}
	\item Centre facelets are attached to the yolk via rivets to create the core (~\ref{part:cross}).
	\item Corner cubelets are locked in place via their extrusions.
	\item Edge pieces are locked in.
	\item Steps (2) and (3) are repeated layer-wise until the cube is complete.
\end{enumerate}
This process is shown in \figref{assembly}.
